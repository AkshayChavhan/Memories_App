# Memories_App
Steps : -

1 _ creating structure for client and server
2_  installing packages and importing 
    for server :_ npm install body-parser cors express mongoose nodemon
    for client :_ npm i axios moment react-file-base64 redux redux-thunk
    react-file-base64 is for images

    cleaning SRC folder

3_Connecting with database from backend : instructions are itself in file too
     to connect server with real database
     https://cloud.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
     create a account
     click on Build a Cluster
     click on Shared cluster
     now go to database access and createa username and password  (akshaychavhan123)

     Now go for add IP address
     Click on connect to cluster 
     you will get link as mongodb+srv://akshaychavhan123:<password>@cluster0.fjmb3gn.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
